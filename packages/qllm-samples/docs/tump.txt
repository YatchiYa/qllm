#### **Early Life and Education**

Born on June 14, 1946, in Queens, New York City, Donald John Trump was the fourth of five children of Fred and Mary Trump. Fred Trump was a successful real estate developer who specialized in building affordable housing in Brooklyn and Queens.

#### **Business Ventures**

After graduating, Trump joined his father’s real estate business, which he renamed The Trump Organization in 1971. His focus shifted to high-profile real estate projects in Manhattan. Trump Tower, completed in 1983, became an iconic skyscraper and a symbol of his brand.

Trump expanded his portfolio to include casinos, hotels, and golf courses. However, his aggressive business style led to significant financial challenges. Several of his businesses declared bankruptcy in the 1990s and 2000s, though Trump himself avoided personal bankruptcy. By leveraging his name as a brand, he licensed it to a wide range of products, from steaks to neckties.

One of Trump’s most notable ventures was his foray into television. From 2004 to 2015, he hosted *The Apprentice*, a reality TV show that bolstered his public image as a decisive and successful businessman.

#### **Political Career**

Trump’s entry into politics was unconventional. He had flirted with political runs in the past, but it was in 2015 that he announced his candidacy for president as a Republican. His campaign, built around the slogan *“Make America Great Again,”* resonated with millions of Americans who felt left behind by globalization and changing social norms.

In 2016, Trump faced former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in one of the most contentious elections in U.S. history. Despite losing the popular vote, Trump secured an Electoral College victory, becoming the first U.S. president without prior military or political experience.

#### **Presidency (2017–2021)**

Trump’s presidency was marked by significant achievements and controversies. He enacted a major tax overhaul, appointed three Supreme Court justices, and prioritized deregulation. His administration pursued an "America First" foreign policy, withdrawing from international agreements like the Paris Climate Accord and the Iran nuclear deal while renegotiating trade agreements such as NAFTA.

However, Trump’s tenure was also marred by scandals. He faced two impeachments: first in 2019 over allegations of pressuring Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden, and second in 2021 for his role in the Capitol riots. He was acquitted both times.

Trump’s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic drew both praise and criticism. While his administration accelerated vaccine development through Operation Warp Speed, his public messaging about the virus often conflicted with health experts.

After leaving office in January 2021, Trump remained an influential figure in the Republican Party.

His platform focuses on immigration, trade, and challenging what he calls "the establishment elite."

Trump also faced numerous legal challenges, including investigations into his business dealings, tax filings, and alleged attempts to overturn the 2020 election results. Despite these controversies, his popularity among his base remains strong.
